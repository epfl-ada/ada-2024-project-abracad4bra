# Horror movies: a window on society 
# Horror movies, the collective nightmares of society 

## Abstract: 
Our project aims to explore the evolution of  horror movies as a reflection of societal fears and transformations. We believe that horror films are acting as the nightmares of society, allowing the audience to confront what scares them in a controlled, metaphorical space, and therefore offer a unique lens to examine collective fears. 
By analyzing horror themes across decades, we are looking at how shifting societal dynamics, such as technological advancements, cultural fears and moral concerns, manifest within this genre. Recent trends, like the rise of movies focused on AI, illustrate how horror adapts to contemporary issues, much as past horror movies reelected anxieties around religion, societal violence. 
This analysis aims to show how horror movies both respond to and shape societal fears and evolutions, ultimately offering insight into society's subconscious and its evolving concerns over time. 

## Research questions 
How did horror movies' scenarios evolve over time ? 
- General evolution of themes addressed 
- Analysis of different tropes 

Are there cultural specificities in horror ? 
- Are the themes addressed different around the world ? 
- Are horror movies as popular a genre everywhere ? 

How horror movies reflect societal evolution on diversity ? 

Do historical events have an impact on horror movies scenarios ? 

## Methods 

## Additional datasets
**Kaggle Horror movies dataset:**
This dataset contains information on 32k movies released between 1950 and 2022. We chose this dataset to complete the original data with more recent movies (fill the gap between 2016 and 2022) and have more movie plots to analyze as we previously only had ~5k horror movies. 

**Trigger warning dataset:**
This dataset comes from the website ‘Doesthedogdie.com’ that regroups a variety of triggering content for thousands of movies, series, books… The developers provided us with a csv file of the list of 50k movies between 1900 and today, and the kind of triggering content they have. 
The concept of studying triggering content (ex : blood, violence, clowns…) is closely related to horror movies, as these films often feature disturbing and frightening themes that may not be suitable for all audiences.
This dataset is then crossed with the other datasets we use for assuring we only keep horror movies.

## Proposed Timeline 
Beginning of the project: Repartition of the different subjects of the project & looking for new datasets (Julie : Introduction and metadata analysis + actor/trope repartition, Elie : Impact of important events on movie industry, Marco : Analysis of tropes and introduction, Valentine C: Analysis of the summaries/cultural specificities, Valentine D: movie content and triggers analysis)

14/11: Sharing of new datasets and beginning of the analysis for each 

21/11: Homework 2. All principal figures need to be chosen, qualitative analysis

28/11: Quantitative analysis and significance tests

05/12: Written analysis of each graph, website development

12/12: Redaction of the final project and aesthetic of the graphs/website

19/12: Proofreading + Final touch
